## Introduction

My name is Alex. Actually, I am a Chinese. I have been thinking about making a series of videos showing you how to develop an iOS application. 

### Difference 
- About 4 months of learning; constantly updated.
- Not a demo application, but a very complex one. Will be submitted to the App Store in the end.

Some of the shortcuts I use frequently.

- Navigation Areas
	- CMD + 0 : file navigator 
	- CMD + option + 0 : attributes pane
	- CMD + shift + y : debugging area

- File Navigator
	- CMD + 0
	- CMD + Shift + j
	- CMD + Shift + o
	- CMD + control + right-arrow : Go forward
	- CMD + control + left-arrow : Go backward

	- CMD + b : build
	- CMD + r : run
	- CMD + shift + k: clean build
	- CMD + k : clear console

#### XVim & Github

XVim2 is a Vim plugin for Xcode. The plugin intends to offer a compelling Vim experience without the need to give up any Xcode features.

### The Way of Learning Recommended

- code along the way
- recap anything learned before sleep
